      Creating a password is optional but advised, 
      as certain features such as having your name on the leaderboard and 
      picking up where you left off are only accessible to password-protected users.
      <br><br>
      However, if you choose to create a password, 
      it is strongly suggested that you do not recycle any of your passwords already in use, 
      as the passwords stored here are not completely secured.
